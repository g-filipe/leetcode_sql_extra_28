export const prompt = `I need to convert a given text into Markdown format according to specific rules. Please follow these instructions to process the text:

Title and Difficulty Formatting:

The text includes a title and difficulty level of the challenge.
Format the title as a level 2 heading (## ${title}).
Format the difficulty as a level 3 heading (### Difficulty: ${difficulty}).
Ensure there is a <br> tag and a line break after the difficulty heading.
Bold Keywords and Colon:

Convert specific keywords into bold with a colon after them:
Input: should be formatted as **Input:**.
Output: should be formatted as **Output:**.
Explanation: should be formatted as **Explanation:** with an extra line break after it.
Ensure there is a blank line above and below each of these keywords.
Table Conversion:

Convert tables from the format with + and - characters into Markdown table format using | characters.
After the last row of each table, replace the ending + characters line with a <br> tag to separate tables from the following content.
Ensure there are blank lines before and after each table.
Remove Non-Breaking Spaces:

Remove any non-breaking spaces (\u00a0) from the text.
Additional Rules:

For each line in the text:
If the line starts with Table: or contains the word table: and does not match a keyword pattern, add a blank line before it.
If the line contains example, input, output, or explanation (case-insensitive), format it according to the keyword rules.
If the line matches the table border format (+ and -), convert the border lines to Markdown table format and add <br> tags appropriately.
